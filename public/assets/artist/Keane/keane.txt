Keane's piano-driven pop/rock cemented them as one of the best-selling and most-beloved bands in U.K. history. Debuting in the early 2000s as part of the wave of post-Coldplay sensitive indie that crashed the mainstream, their first album, the anthemic Hopes and Fears, was a commercial and critical success that endured well beyond its 2004 release, pushing darker sophomore effort Under the Iron Sea to the top of the charts in the U.K. After capping a successful decade with the synth-driven, Bowie-indebted Perfect Symmetry (2008) and its worldly companion EP, Night Train (2010), the quartet entered a period rife with personal struggle and uncertainty that resulted in an extended hiatus following the release of their fifth straight chart-topper, 2012's Strangeland. Addiction, divorce, and multiple side projects kept the spirit of Keane alive for much of the 2010s, while devoted fans held onto the hope that they would eventually return. In 2019, the band made their comeback with fifth LP Cause and Effect, their first studio full-length in seven years. The band initially comprised vocalist Tom Chaplin, drummer Richard Hughes, and pianist Tim Rice-Oxley, three childhood friends from the small town of Battle in East Sussex, England. Formed in 1997, the group started out as a college-aged cover band. Guitarist Dominic Scott was also part of this early incarnation, having previously played cover songs with Hughes and Rice-Oxley in a band named the Lotus Eaters. Keane toured the East Sussex circuit for several years while internalizing the epic sounds of their set list, which included songs by Oasis, U2, and the Beatles. The quartet began performing original material in 1998, although Chaplin left for Edinburgh University shortly thereafter to study art history. The move proved to be brief, as he returned to London in 1999 and doubled his efforts with Keane.

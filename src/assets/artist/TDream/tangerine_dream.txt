Tangerine Dream are unquestionably one of the most influential electronic groups of all time. Their music has made an immeasurable impact on ambient, new age, techno, trance, and progressive rock, as well as modern film score composition. Founded as a psychedelic rock group in 1967 by Edgar Froese, the group was initially associated with the Krautrock scene through early abstract albums like 1970's Electronic Meditation and 1972's Zeit. They pioneered the use of sequencers with classic albums like 1974's Phaedra and 1975's Rubycon, which proved to be commercially successful. They became prolific film composers, most notably scoring the 1983 blockbuster Risky Business. Subsequent albums such as 1985's Le Parc and 1988's Optical Race incorporated more digital instrumentation, as well as shorter, more pop-oriented compositions than their earlier epics. During the '90s, albums such as 1995's Tyranny of Beauty were closer to the forms of dance music that Tangerine Dream had heavily influenced. During the 21st century, TD gradually drifted back toward the sequencer-driven sound they had pioneered during the '70s. Froese passed away in 2015, but a trio lineup (including notable electronic musician Ulrich Schnauss) continued to record and perform, remaining true to Froese's vision with the 2017 full-length Quantum Gate.
